"""Landmark extraction + rule-based face-shape classification.

Uses MediaPipe's Task API (`mediapipe.tasks.vision.FaceLandmarker`) — the newer
`mediapipe.solutions.face_mesh` legacy API this plan originally assumed is bundled in
the pip package has been **removed** as of the `mediapipe` version resolved fresh by
this Dockerfile (verified: `mediapipe==0.10.35` only exposes `mp.tasks`, `mp.Image`,
`mp.ImageFormat` — `mp.solutions` no longer exists). `FaceLandmarker` needs a `.task`
model file, which is downloaded at Docker build time (see `Dockerfile`) into
`MODEL_PATH` below rather than at request time, so there is no runtime network
dependency and no missing-file surprise on first request. It returns the same 468/478
-point landmark topology as the old Face Mesh solution, so the landmark indices below
are unchanged.

The landmarker also needs `libEGL`/`libGLESv2` at the OS level (beyond the `libgl1`/
`libglib2.0-0` already in the Dockerfile for OpenCV) — verified by directly running
the built image; see `Dockerfile` for the added `libgles2 libegl1` packages.

    Thresholds below are literature-based approximations commonly cited in face-shape
    analysis guides (e.g. face-length/width and jaw/cheekbone/forehead ratio bands used
    by consumer face-shape quizzes and dermatology/styling references). They are a
    documented judgment call, not a trained/validated model — reasonable
    starting cutoffs, easy to tune later:

    - `length_to_width_ratio` (face_length / cheekbone_width):
        > 1.15  -> face is notably longer than wide  -> OBLONG candidate
        <= 0.95 -> face is about as wide as (or wider than) long -> ROUND/SQUARE candidate
        otherwise -> "balanced" length -> OVAL/HEART/DIAMOND candidate
    - `cheekbone_to_jaw_ratio` (jaw_width / cheekbone_width):
        >= 0.95 -> jaw is nearly as wide as cheekbones -> boxier (SQUARE/ROUND) jaw
        <  0.80 -> jaw notably narrower than cheekbones -> tapered (HEART/DIAMOND) jaw
    - `forehead_to_jaw_ratio` (forehead_width / jaw_width):
        >= 1.10 -> forehead notably wider than jaw -> HEART candidate
        <= 0.90 -> jaw notably wider than forehead -> triangle-ish, folded into SQUARE/ROUND below
        otherwise -> forehead/jaw comparable

    Decision order (most distinctive ratio first):
    1. OBLONG: long face (length_to_width_ratio > 1.15) with a boxy jaw
       (cheekbone_to_jaw_ratio >= 0.85) — long AND fairly uniform width top-to-bottom.
    2. HEART: wide forehead relative to jaw (forehead_to_jaw_ratio >= 1.10) with a
       tapered jaw (cheekbone_to_jaw_ratio < 0.85).
    3. DIAMOND: narrow forehead AND narrow jaw relative to cheekbones
       (forehead_to_jaw_ratio < 0.90 and cheekbone_to_jaw_ratio < 0.80) — cheekbones are
       the widest point, both forehead and jaw taper in.
    4. SQUARE: boxy jaw (cheekbone_to_jaw_ratio >= 0.90) and a face that is not much
       longer than wide (length_to_width_ratio <= 1.05) — strong, angular jawline.
    5. ROUND: short/balanced face (length_to_width_ratio <= 0.95) that isn't boxy
       enough to be SQUARE.
    6. OVAL: default/fallback — balanced ratios that don't clearly match the above
       (the "no strong distinguishing feature" case, consistent with OVAL being the
       most common baseline shape in face-shape literature).

    Confidence is a heuristic 0-1 score: how far the deciding ratio sits from the
    nearest threshold, scaled and clamped — a modest distance from a boundary yields
    a modest confidence rather than a hard 0/1, since this is a rule-based estimate,
    not a calibrated classifier probability.
