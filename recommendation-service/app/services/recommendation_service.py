"""Face-shape -> frame-shape ranking use-case for `POST /recommend`.

Design choice (plan T5 left this to the coding agent — documenting the choice here):
this service calls product-service's `GET /products?faceShape=...` **once** per
request (passing through the optional gender/price filters as extra query params so
product-service does that filtering server-side), then re-ranks the returned products
client-side using the T2 face-shape -> frame-shape score table, rather than issuing one
call per candidate frame shape.

Why: `GET /products?faceShape=X` already returns exactly the pool of products this
service is allowed to recommend for face shape X (every product whose `faceShapes`
includes that face shape), regardless of the product's own `frameShape`. Doing
N calls (one per candidate frame shape in the T2 mapping) would mean unioning many
paginated calls back together and would still miss/duplicate products whose tagged
face shape doesn't line up 1:1 with their own frame shape — needless complexity for no
extra correctness. A single call keeps this simple and avoids N network round-trips
against a downstream call that can already time out (NFR3); de-duping isn't needed
since a single page of results has no repeats.

Ranking: each returned product's own `frameShape` is looked up in the T2 table for the
requested `faceShape` to get its score (falls back to 0.0 if a product's frame shape
isn't in the table — shouldn't happen since the table covers all 8 `FrameShape`
values, but keeps this defensive rather than raising on unexpected data).
